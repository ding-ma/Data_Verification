How the program works:
-Enter Start and End Date
It will generate the corresponding monthly report for O3, PM2.5, and NO2.

The program requires 2 packages:
openpyxl, version: 2.6.2
xlsxwriter, version 1.1.8

To install the package do the following command:
pip3 install openpyxl==2.6.2 --user
pip3 install xlsxwriter==1.1.8 --user

Those command are entered directly into the command line and press enter after one.
The program has an alias associated in the home/~user/.profile.d/interactive/pre file with
alias INFOSMOG="path/of/program && python3 -m extractData.py"

To add/remove stations, open the appropriate config file.
-StationNO2.csv for NO2 stations
-StationO3.csv for O3 stations
-StationPM25.csv for PM25 stations

The format of the file goes as:
ID:EC,Region.

The region is used in the region hour max sheet. Make sure they are the same otherwise the program will not include that region into the calculations.
The order which the stations appears in the csv file is **IMPORTANT**. The ouput file will follow that exact order. Make sure that when adding a station in an existing region, write it with the group, not at the end. 


For example, in my StationPM25.csv, I would like to add DCBA station in the GRM region.
Opening the file, you will see:

CMVQ,GRM
[...]
CMSS,GRM
CGTZ,GRM
CMTI,Dru
[...]
CMPE,Lac

The file with the station added could look like this if you want DCBA to appear before CGTZ:

CMVQ,GRM
[...]
CMSS,GRM
BCBA,GRM
CGTZ,GRM
CMTI,Dru
[...]
CMPE,Lac

Note: There is no space separating the ID:EC and Region.

Make sure that the station that you are adding also *exists* in the NAPS_PB. It will convert the ID:EC (4 character code)
into a NAPS code (all digits). Currently, the file only contains Quebec stations but other province station can be added 
as long as:
1- The NAPS code exists in BD-AIQA
2- The ID:EC has a conversion to NAPS. It can be user defined such as ABCD = 50119. the ID:EC is made up but the NAPS is real.
